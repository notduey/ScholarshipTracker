# scholarship-tracker
This is my first python project, this console program tracks the scholarships I add along with information including: name, link, amount, deadline, completion status, essay requirement, and additional notes. It supports adding, viewing, editing, and deleting scholarships, with all data stored in a CSV file for persistence. This project spanned a little over 3 weeks and there was very light AI assistance, mostly for sanity checks and structuring program, almost all of the logic was done by me albeit with minimal help from chatgpt.

Skills learned/emphasizes when building this project:
-Designed a modular program across multiple .py files (data handling, menus, editing, viewing)
-Used Python’s csv, datetime, locale, and other relevant modules for real-world functionality
-Implemented time consuming but robust input validation and error handling
-Applied clean code principles with docstrings, readable structure, and cross-platform formatting
-Strengthened understanding of loops, lists, file I/O, and user interaction logic
